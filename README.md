## Introduction to vertex shader, fragment shader and rasterization.

This introductory section is meant to provide a high-level overview of the concepts of a vertex shader, fragment shader and rasterization. We will sacrifice some technical rigor for simplicity and ease of understanding, but this simplified mental model should suffice for the assignments in this course. Also, you will not have to implement almost any of the following concepts covered, but it is very important to understand what is going on "under the hood" to complete your assignments.

A vertex is a point in 3D space. A fragment can simply be thought of as a pixel on your screen, or in other words, a square on a 2D grid that lays on the image plane. Vertices can be located at any position of the 3D space (continuous positions) while fragments are located in certain positions given by a 2D grid, since the screen is a fixed grid of pixels with fixed locations and sizes.
For simplicity, let's assume we have a single triangle in our scene. A single 3D triangle is our starting point. Our end goal is to render this triangle on the screen.
A 3D triangle is formed by 3 3D vertices. Each triangle intially lies in a continous 3D space and will need two main steps in order to be rendered with pixels located on fixed (discrete) positions. First, the triangle will be projected onto the screen plane with some projection matrix. After this step, we can now think of our triangle as a 2D triangle, since it was projected to the image plane. These vertices can still be contiuous poins of space, but they now lay on a 2D plane, the screen plane. The second step is rasterization. Rasterizing is the process of converting the continuous triangles into a some approximation of a triangle formed by many squares (pixels/fragments). In the following image you can see the process of rasterization, where we have a 2D "continuous" triangle which is rasterized into a set of discrete pixels (right-most image).

![image-1](docs/rasterization.png)

The process of rasterization involves two main steps, or answering two questions: 1: "*which* pixels should we color in order to represent the triangle?", and 2: "*what color* should we color each pixel that is covered by that triangle?".
The answer to the first question would be, in our case, a list of 16 fragment positions, as we observe 16 pixels are covered by this triangle. Perhaps the second question seems absurdly simple to answer: "we should color the pixels with the color of the triangle". However, in reality, triangles can have different colors at each vertex, and the color of a pixel that is covered by a triangle is not always simply the color of the triangle. The color of a pixel is determined by interpolating the colors of the vertices that form the triangle.

Generally, we should assume that the 3 vertices of a triangle have different properties, such as different color. Let's assume that we have defined a triangle such that two vertices are white and one vertex is black. Now the intermetiade colors are not going to be so trivial to compute as in a fully blue triangle. We would like the triangle to have a kind of gradient of shades of gray that smoothly go from white in the two white vertices to black in the black vertex. To achieve this, we will use barycentric interpolation. You can see barycentric interpolation as a way to obtain the color of any point inside a triangle, given the color of the three vertices, their respective positions and the position of the point that we are trying to compute the color for. Intuitively, the closer the point is to a vertex, the more the color of that vertex will contribute to the final color of that point. 
Now let's assume we already done step 1 of rasterization: we already know which pixels are covered by the triangle. Now, in order to answer "which color should we color each pixel", we will go throgh all pixels that are covered by the triangle.
For each pixel, we know its position in space. Now we can use barycentric interpolation to compute the color of that pixel, given its position and the colors of the three vertices.

### Vertex shader. 
The vertex shader is a program (think about it as a function) that is executed on each vertex of a triangle. This will be our first step of the pipeline. One of the tasks of the vertex shader is to transform the 3D continuous vertices into projected points onto the image 2D plane. Typically, this step within the vertex shader will look somewhat like this: 
```javascript
gl_Position = projection_camera_model_transform * vec4(position, 1.0);
```
This step is typically going to be exactly the same in most vertex shaders. `position` is the vertex position in object space (3D space), `vec4(position, 1.0)` is converting to homogeneous coordinates. `projection_camera_model_transform` is a matrix that is obtained by combining multiple transformations, from object space to projection space. When multiplying this combined transformation matrix by `position`, we are projecting the point from object space into screen space and storing the result to `gl_Position`.
 `gl_Position` is a special variable that is used to specify the position of the vertex after it has been transformed by the model, view and projection matrices.
 
 The vertex shader can also have other tasks. Let's go back to the example where we have a triangle with 3 vertices with different colors. We want to "interpolate" these colors into each of the intermediate fragments. Luckily, our graphics engine will take care of all of this. All we need to do is "tell the engine that we need to interpolate the color". Assuming that our vertex color is stored in a variable called `vertex_color`, we can tell the graphics engine to interpolate the color by adding the following line to our vertex shader:
```javascript
varying vec3 interpolate_color;
void main() {
    interpolate_color = vertex_color;
}
```
The name of the variable `interpolate_color` is not important. What matters is we used the keyword `varying` before the type (`vec3`). This tells the graphics engine that we want to interpolate the value of this variable. The graphics engine will automatically interpolate the value of `interpolate_color` for each fragment that is covered by the triangle. The interpolated value will then be available in the fragment shader.

The next part we will have to implement is the fragment shader. However, a lot will have happened under the hood before the fragment shader is actually run. After the vertex shader and before the fragment shader, the graphics engine will 1) determine which pixels are covered by each triangle and 2) perform barycentric interpolation to all variables that were marked as `varying` in the vertex shader. The interpolated values will be available in the fragment shader.

### Fragment shader
The fragment shader is a program that is executed on each fragment (pixel) that is covered by a triangle. The fragment shader will receive the interpolated values from the vertex shader and will be responsible for determining the final color of each pixel.
In our simple example, the fragment shader will look like this:
```javascript
varying vec3 interpolated_color;
void main() {
    gl_FragColor = vec4(interpolated_color, 1.0);
}
```
Note that we are definying the same variable `varying vec3 interpolated_color` that we defined in the vertex shader. This is how the fragment shader receives the interpolated values from the vertex shader. You need to make sure that the type and name of the varible is the same as you defined it in the vertex shader.
`gl_FragColor` is a special variable that is used to specify the color of the fragment.


### An example: Phong shading
The Phong shading is characterized by the fact that the color is computed per fragment (pixel). This means that in the Phong shading, we will interpolate the properties that affect the color and compute the color at each fragment. You will learn the detail of how this color is computed, but for now think about it as some function that takes into account the material propertes, the light direction, the surface direcetion, the eye (view) direction to output a color. 
Let's define the vertex shader:
```javascript
varying vec3 interpolated_normal;
varying vec3 interpolated_position;

// Let's define a function that computes the normal and position per vertex
void main() { 
    // Transform the vertex position
    gl_Position = projection_camera_model_transform * vec4(position, 1.0);

    // Pass the normal and position to the fragment shader for interpolation
    interpolated_normal = normalize((model_transform * vec4(normal, 0.0)).xyz);
    interpolated_position = (model_transform * vec4(position, 1.0)).xyz;
}
```
Here, we are computing the transformed normal and position at each vertex and passing them as `varying` variables so they can be interpolated across the surface of the triangle.

Now, in the fragment shader, we compute the final color per pixel:

```javascript
varying vec3 interpolated_normal;
varying vec3 interpolated_position;

// Let's define a function that computes the color of a fragment
vec4 compute_color(vec3 normal, vec3 position, some_parameters) {
    // Compute color based on interpolated parameters
    return color;
}

void main() {
    vec3 normal = normalize(interpolated_normal);
    vec3 position = interpolated_position;
    
    vec4 color = compute_color(normal, position, some_parameters);
    
    gl_FragColor = color;
}
```

Here, the interpolated values (`interpolated_normal`, `interpolated_position`) are used to compute the lighting at each fragment. 

### Next step: Gouraud shading
You will have to implement Gouraud shading.
Phong and Gouraud have a lot of common. The main difference is that in the Phong shading, the color is computed per fragment (pixel). This means that in the Phong shading, we will interpolate the properties that affect the color and compute the color at each fragment. In contrast, in the Gouraud shading, the color is computed per vertex and then interpolated across the surface of the triangle. Remember the function (compute_color) that computes the color of a vertex? In the Gouraud shading, we will compute the color of each vertex and pass it to the fragment shader. The fragment shader will then interpolate these colors across the surface of the triangle.

We used the example of `interpolate_normal` and `interpolated_position` to illustrate the concept of interpolation, but you can define arbitrary variables with the `varying` keyword and this will be interpolated for each fragment. 

### Some notes
We discussed the example of a single triangle. In practice, we have thousands of triangles in a scene, but each of them will be processed in the same way. The vertex shader will be executed for each vertex of each triangle, and the fragment shader will be executed for each pixel that is covered by any triangle. The graphics engine will take care of all the details of how to efficiently execute these shaders on the GPU and which triangles to actually in the screen depending on which are visible from our perspective, etc.

Typically, the vertex and fragment shader are defined per-shape, per-object or material. Meaning there are many triangles that share the same shaders but typically different obects will have different materials or shaders.

Feel free to look up alternative material, ask an LLM or visit the shaders subreddit if you want to learn more about the topic.






1. **Project Setup**  
   - Need to run npm install to install the dependencies and npx vite to start the server, just like the previous assignment.
   - Open the provided project. The main JavaScript file is `main.js`.
   - The initial scene contains a single sphere in the middle. The camera is located in the position that looks down the entire solar system, and you don't need to make change to that. You will replace the sphere in the middle with the solar system as specified below.

2. **Code Structure**  
   - Familiarize yourself with the functions provided for creating translation and rotation matrices similar to Assignment 2:
     ```javascript
     function translationMatrix(tx, ty, tz) { /* ... */ }
     function rotationMatrixX(theta) { /* ... */ }
     function rotationMatrixY(theta) { /* ... */ }
     function rotationMatrixZ(theta) { /* ... */ }
     ```
   - The `animate()` function contains the main animation loop.

3. **Implementation Notes** 
   - Areas where you need to add or modify code are indicated with comments or `TODO` statements.
   - Feel free to create additional helper functions as needed.

- **Create a spherical sun at the origin** using `THREE.SphereGeometry()` with a radius of `1` and segments of `32` for both width and height.
- **Animate the sun's radius and color** over a **10-second period**:
  - **Size Animation**: The sun should swell from radius `1` up to `3` and then back down to `1` in a linear fashion.
  - **Color Animation**: The sun should fade from **red** when it's smallest to **white** when it's largest.
- **Implementation hint**:
  - The following example code shows how to create a planet with customized material and geometry:
  ```javascript
    let planetGeometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry(4, 7, 9); // create a sphere with radius 4, 7 width segments and 9 height segments
    let planetMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
        color: 0xff0000
    }); // create a material with color red
    const planet = new THREE.Mesh(
        planetGeometry,
        planetMaterial
    );
    ```
  - To change the size of the sun, you can use the `scale` property of the mesh object and call `*.scale.set(x, y, z)` to set the scale of the mesh.
  - To change the color of the sun, you can use the `material.color` property of the mesh object and call `*.setRGB(r, g, b)` to set the color of the material.
  - Use the `clock.getElapsedTime()` function to track time.

    - **Blending Factor**: Use a blending factor (e.g., `0.1`) to interpolate the camera's position for smooth movement.
    - **Offset**: Add an offset in front of the planet to position the camera (e.g., `translationMatrix(0, 0, 10)`).
  - If camera is detached, revert to the default camera position and enable orbit controls.

**b. Smooth Camera Transition (1 point)**
